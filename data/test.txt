/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5695/3570-5695-0001.wav the dependent who was first delegated for these duties was the wife or the chief wife and as would be expected in the later development of the institution when the number of persons by whom these duties are customarily performed gradually narrows the wife remains the last
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5695/3570-5695-0002.wav but as we descend the social scale the point is presently reached where the duties of vicarious leisure and consumption devolve upon the wife alone
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5695/3570-5695-0003.wav in the communities of the western culture this point is at present found among the lower middle class
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5695/3570-5695-0004.wav if beauty or comfort is achieved and it is a more or less fortuitous circumstance if they are they must be achieved by means and methods that commend themselves to the great economic law of wasted effort
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5695/3570-5695-0005.wav the man of the household also can do something in this direction and indeed he commonly does but with a still lower descent into the levels of indigence along the margin of the slums the man and presently also the children virtually cease to consume valuable goods for appearances and the woman remains virtually the sole exponent of the households pecuniary decency
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5695/3570-5695-0006.wav very much of squalor and discomfort will be endured before the last trinket or the last pretense of pecuniary decency is put away
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5695/3570-5695-0007.wav there is no class and no country that has yielded so abjectly before the pressure of physical want as to deny themselves all gratification of this higher or spiritual need
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5695/3570-5695-0008.wav the question is which of the two methods will most effectively reach the persons whose convictions it is desired to affect
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5695/3570-5695-0009.wav each will therefore serve about equally well during the earlier stages of social growth
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5695/3570-5695-0010.wav the modern organization of industry works in the same direction also by another line
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5695/3570-5695-0011.wav it is evident therefore that the present trend of the development is in the direction of heightening the utility of conspicuous consumption as compared with leisure
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5695/3570-5695-0012.wav it is also noticeable that the serviceability of consumption as a means of repute as well as the insistence on it as an element of decency is at its best in those portions of the community where the human contact of the individual is widest and the mobility of the population is greatest
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5695/3570-5695-0013.wav consumption becomes a larger element in the standard of living in the city than in the country
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5695/3570-5695-0014.wav among the country population its place is to some extent taken by savings and home comforts known through the medium of neighborhood gossip sufficiently to serve the like general purpose of pecuniary repute
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5695/3570-5695-0015.wav the result is a great mobility of the labor employed in printing perhaps greater than in any other equally well defined and considerable body of workmen
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0000.wav but already at a point in economic evolution far antedating the emergence of the lady specialised consumption of goods as an evidence of pecuniary strength had begun to work out in a more or less elaborate system
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0001.wav the utility of consumption as an evidence of wealth is to be classed as a derivative growth
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0002.wav such consumption as falls to the women is merely incidental to their work it is a means to their continued labour and not a consumption directed to their own comfort and fulness of life
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0003.wav with a further advance in culture this tabu may change into simple custom of a more or less rigorous character but whatever be the theoretical basis of the distinction which is maintained whether it be a tabu or a larger conventionality the features of the conventional scheme of consumption do not change easily
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0004.wav in the nature of things luxuries and the comforts of life belong to the leisure class
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0005.wav under the tabu certain victuals and more particularly certain beverages are strictly reserved for the use of the superior class
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0006.wav drunkenness and the other pathological consequences of the free use of stimulants therefore tend in their turn to become honorific as being a mark at the second remove of the superior status of those who are able to afford the indulgence
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0007.wav it has even happened that the name for certain diseased conditions of the body arising from such an origin has passed into everyday speech as a synonym for noble or gentle
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0008.wav the consumption of luxuries in the true sense is a consumption directed to the comfort of the consumer himself and is therefore a mark of the master
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0009.wav with many qualifications with more qualifications as the patriarchal tradition has gradually weakened the general rule is felt to be right and binding that women should consume only for the benefit of their masters
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0010.wav the objection of course presents itself that expenditure on womens dress and household paraphernalia is an obvious exception to this rule but it will appear in the sequel that this exception is much more obvious than substantial
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0011.wav the custom of festive gatherings probably originated in motives of conviviality and religion these motives are also present in the later development but they do not continue to be the sole motives
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0012.wav there is a more or less elaborate system of rank and grades
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0013.wav this differentiation is furthered by the inheritance of wealth and the consequent inheritance of gentility
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0014.wav many of these affiliated gentlemen of leisure are at the same time lesser men of substance in their own right so that some of them are scarcely at all others only partially to be rated as vicarious consumers
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0015.wav so many of them however as make up the retainer and hangers on of the patron may be classed as vicarious consumer without qualification
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0016.wav many of these again and also many of the other aristocracy of less degree have in turn attached to their persons a more or less comprehensive group of vicarious consumer in the persons of their wives and children their servants retainers et cetera
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0017.wav the wearing of uniforms or liveries implies a considerable degree of dependence and may even be said to be a mark of servitude real or ostensible
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0018.wav the wearers of uniforms and liveries may be roughly divided into two classes the free and the servile or the noble and the ignoble
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0019.wav but the general distinction is not on that account to be overlooked
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0020.wav so those offices which are by right the proper employment of the leisure class are noble such as government fighting hunting the care of arms and accoutrements and the like in short those which may be classed as ostensibly predatory employments
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0021.wav whenever as in these cases the menial service in question has to do directly with the primary leisure employments of fighting and hunting it easily acquires a reflected honorific character
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0022.wav the livery becomes obnoxious to nearly all who are required to wear it
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5696/3570-5696-0000.wav under the simple test of effectiveness for advertising we should expect to find leisure and the conspicuous consumption of goods dividing the field of pecuniary emulation pretty evenly between them at the outset
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5696/3570-5696-0001.wav but the actual course of development has been somewhat different from this ideal scheme leisure held the first place at the start and came to hold a rank very much above wasteful consumption of goods both as a direct exponent of wealth and as an element in the standard of decency during the quasi peaceable culture

/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5696/3570-5696-0003.wav a reconciliation between the two conflicting requirements is effected by a resort to make believe many and intricate polite observances and social duties of a ceremonial nature are developed many organizations are founded with some specious object of amelioration embodied in their official style and title there is much coming and going and a deal of talk to the end that the talkers may not have occasion to reflect on what is the effectual economic value of their traffic
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5696/3570-5696-0004.wav the salient features of this development of domestic service have already been indicated
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5696/3570-5696-0005.wav throughout the entire evolution of conspicuous expenditure whether of goods or of services or human life runs the obvious implication that in order to effectually mend the consumers good fame it must be an expenditure of superfluities
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5696/3570-5696-0006.wav as used in the speech of everyday life the word carries an undertone of deprecation
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5696/3570-5696-0007.wav the use of the word waste as a technical term therefore implies no deprecation of the motives or of the ends sought by the consumer under this canon of conspicuous waste
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5696/3570-5696-0008.wav but it is on other grounds worth noting that the term waste in the language of everyday life implies deprecation of what is characterized as wasteful
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5696/3570-5696-0009.wav in strict accuracy nothing should be included under the head of conspicuous waste but such expenditure as is incurred on the ground of an invidious pecuniary comparison
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3570/5696/3570-5696-0010.wav an article may be useful and wasteful both and its utility to the consumer may be made up of use and waste in the most varying proportions

/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0000.wav the analysis of knowledge will occupy us until the end of the thirteenth lecture and is the most difficult part of our whole enterprise
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0001.wav what is called perception differs from sensation by the fact that the sensational ingredients bring up habitual associates images and expectations of their usual correlates all of which are subjectively indistinguishable from the sensation
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0002.wav whether or not this principle is liable to exceptions everyone would agree that is has a broad measure of truth though the word exactly might seem an overstatement and it might seem more correct to say that ideas approximately represent impressions
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0003.wav and what sort of evidence is logically possible
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0004.wav there is no logical impossibility in the hypothesis that the world sprang into being five minutes ago exactly as it then was with a population that remembered a wholly unreal past
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0005.wav all that i am doing is to use its logical tenability as a help in the analysis of what occurs when we remember
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0006.wav the behaviourist who attempts to make psychology a record of behaviour has to trust his memory in making the record
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0007.wav habit is a concept involving the occurrence of similar events at different times if the behaviourist feels confident that there is such a phenomenon as habit that can only be because he trusts his memory when it assures him that there have been other times
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0008.wav but i do not think such an inference is warranted
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0009.wav our confidence or lack of confidence in the accuracy of a memory image must in fundamental cases be based upon a characteristic of the image itself since we cannot evoke the past bodily and compare it with the present image
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0010.wav we sometimes have images that are by no means peculiarly vague which yet we do not trust for example under the influence of fatigue we may see a friends face vividly and clearly but horribly distorted
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0011.wav some images like some sensations feel very familiar while others feel strange
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0012.wav familiarity is a feeling capable of degrees
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0013.wav in an image of a well known face for example some parts may feel more familiar than others when this happens we have more belief in the accuracy of the familiar parts than in that of the unfamiliar parts
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0014.wav i come now to the other characteristic which memory images must have in order to account for our knowledge of the past
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0015.wav they must have some characteristic which makes us regard them as referring to more or less remote portions of the past
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0016.wav in actual fact there are doubtless various factors that concur in giving us the feeling of greater or less remoteness in some remembered event
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0017.wav there may be a specific feeling which could be called the feeling of pastness especially where immediate memory is concerned
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0018.wav there is of course a difference between knowing the temporal relation of a remembered event to the present and knowing the time order of two remembered events
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0019.wav it would seem that only rather recent events can be placed at all accurately by means of feelings giving their temporal relation to the present but it is clear that such feelings must play an essential part in the process of dating remembered events
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0020.wav if we had retained the subject or act in knowledge the whole problem of memory would have been comparatively simple
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0021.wav remembering has to be a present occurrence in some way resembling or related to what is remembered
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0022.wav some points may be taken as fixed and such as any theory of memory must arrive at
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0023.wav in this case as in most others what may be taken as certain in advance is rather vague
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0024.wav the first of our vague but indubitable data is that there is knowledge of the past
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0025.wav we might provisionally though perhaps not quite correctly define memory as that way of knowing about the past which has no analogue in our knowledge of the future such a definition would at least serve to mark the problem with which we are concerned though some expectations may deserve to rank with memory as regards immediacy
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0026.wav this distinction is vital to the understanding of memory but it is not so easy to carry out in practice as it is to draw in theory
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0027.wav a gramophone by the help of suitable records might relate to us the incidents of its past and people are not so different from gramophones as they like to believe
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0028.wav i can set to work now to remember things i never remembered before such as what i had to eat for breakfast this morning and it can hardly be wholly habit that enables me to do this
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0029.wav the fact that a man can recite a poem does not show that he remembers any previous occasion on which he has recited or read it
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0030.wav semons two books mentioned in an earlier lecture do not touch knowledge memory at all closely
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0031.wav they give laws according to which images of past occurrences come into our minds but do not discuss our belief that these images refer to past occurrences which is what constitutes knowledge memory
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0032.wav it is this that is of interest to theory of knowledge
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0033.wav it is by no means always reliable almost everybody has at some time experienced the well known illusion that all that is happening now happened before at some time
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0034.wav whenever the sense of familiarity occurs without a definite object it leads us to search the environment until we are satisfied that we have found the appropriate object which leads us to the judgment this is familiar
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0035.wav thus no knowledge as to the past is to be derived from the feeling of familiarity alone
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0036.wav a further stage is recognition
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0037.wav recognition in this sense does not necessarily involve more than a habit of association the kind of object we are seeing at the moment is associated with the word cat or with an auditory image of purring or whatever other characteristic we may happen to recognize in the cat of the moment
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0038.wav we are of course in fact able to judge when we recognize an object that we have seen it before but this judgment is something over and above recognition in this first sense and may very probably be impossible to animals that nevertheless have the experience of recognition in this first sense of the word
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0039.wav this knowledge is memory in one sense though in another it is not
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0040.wav there are however several points in which such an account of recognition is inadequate to begin with it might seem at first sight more correct to define recognition as i have seen this before than as this has existed before
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0041.wav the definition of my experience is difficult broadly speaking it is everything that is connected with what i am experiencing now by certain links of which the various forms of memory are among the most important
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0042.wav thus if i recognize a thing the occasion of its previous existence in virtue of which i recognize it forms part of my experience by definition recognition will be one of the marks by which my experience is singled out from the rest of the world
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0043.wav of course the words this has existed before are a very inadequate translation of what actually happens when we form a judgment of recognition but that is unavoidable words are framed to express a level of thought which is by no means primitive and are quite incapable of expressing such an elementary occurrence as recognition
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/237/126133/237-126133-0000.wav here she would stay comforted and soothed among the lovely plants and rich exotics rejoicing the heart of old turner the gardener who since pollys first rapturous entrance had taken her into his good graces for all time
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/237/126133/237-126133-0001.wav every chance she could steal after practice hours were over and after the clamorous demands of the boys upon her time were fully satisfied was seized to fly on the wings of the wind to the flowers

/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/237/126133/237-126133-0015.wav yes all alone by himself asserted jasper vehemently and winking furiously to the others to stop their laughing he did now truly phronsie

/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0033.wav but your power is so superior to any that i can advance as to make us here feel that there is no disgrace in yielding to it
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0034.wav not a doubt but had your force been only double or treble our own i should have found it my duty to struggle with you

/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0043.wav but what is the delicate mission i asked

/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0045.wav then the republic of britannula was to be declared as non existent and the british flag was to be exalted and a british governor installed in the executive chambers
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0046.wav you may be quite sure its there said captain battleax and that i can so use it as to half obliterate your town within two minutes of my return on board
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0047.wav you propose to kidnap me i said
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0048.wav what would become of your gun were i to kidnap you
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0049.wav lieutenant crosstrees is a very gallant officer
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0050.wav one of us always remains on board while the other is on shore
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0051.wav what world wide iniquity such a speech as that discloses said i still turning myself to the captain for though i would have crushed them both by my words had it been possible my dislike centred itself on sir ferdinando
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0052.wav you will allow me to suggest said he that that is a matter of opinion
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0053.wav were i to comply with your orders without expressing my own opinion i should seem to have done so willingly hereafter
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0054.wav the letter ran as follows
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0055.wav sir i have it in command to inform your excellency that you have been appointed governor of the crown colony which is called britannula
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0056.wav the peculiar circumstances of the colony are within your excellencys knowledge
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0057.wav but in their selection of a constitution the britannulists have unfortunately allowed themselves but one deliberative assembly and hence have sprung their present difficulties
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0058.wav it is founded on the acknowledged weakness of those who survive that period of life at which men cease to work
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0059.wav but it is surmised that you will find difficulties in the way of your entering at once upon your government
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0060.wav the john bright is armed with a weapon of great power against which it is impossible that the people of britannula should prevail
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0061.wav you will carry out with you one hundred men of the north north west birmingham regiment which will probably suffice for your own security as it is thought that if mister neverbend be withdrawn the people will revert easily to their old habits of obedience
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0062.wav when do you intend that the john bright shall start
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0063.wav to day i shouted
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0064.wav and i have no one ready to whom i can give up the archives of the government
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0065.wav i shall be happy to take charge of them said sir ferdinando
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0066.wav they of course must all be altered
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0067.wav or of the habits of our people it is quite impossible
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0068.wav your power is sufficient i said
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0069.wav if you will give us your promise to meet captain battleax here at this time to morrow we will stretch a point and delay the departure of the john bright for twenty four hours
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0070.wav and this plan was adopted too in order to extract from me a promise that i would depart in peace
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0000.wav you will find me continually speaking of four men titian holbein turner and tintoret in almost the same terms
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0001.wav they unite every quality and sometimes you will find me referring to them as colorists sometimes as chiaroscurists
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0002.wav by being studious of color they are studious of division and while the chiaroscurist devotes himself to the representation of degrees of force in one thing unseparated light the colorists have for their function the attainment of beauty by arrangement of the divisions of light
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0003.wav my first and principal reason was that they enforced beyond all resistance on any student who might attempt to copy them this method of laying portions of distinct hue side by side
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0004.wav some of the touches indeed when the tint has been mixed with much water have been laid in little drops or ponds so that the pigment might crystallize hard at the edge
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0005.wav it is the head of a parrot with a little flower in his beak from a picture of carpaccios one of his series of the life of saint george
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0006.wav then he comes to the beak of it
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0007.wav the brown ground beneath is left for the most part one touch of black is put for the hollow two delicate lines of dark gray define the outer curve and one little quivering touch of white draws the inner edge of the mandible
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0008.wav for believe me the final philosophy of art can only ratify their opinion that the beauty of a cock robin is to be red and of a grass plot to be green and the best skill of art is in instantly seizing on the manifold deliciousness of light which you can only seize by precision of instantaneous touch
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0009.wav now you will see in these studies that the moment the white is inclosed properly and harmonized with the other hues it becomes somehow more precious and pearly than the white paper and that i am not afraid to leave a whole field of untreated white paper all round it being sure that even the little diamonds in the round window will tell as jewels if they are gradated justly
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0010.wav but in this vignette copied from turner you have the two principles brought out perfectly
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0011.wav they are beyond all other works that i know existing dependent for their effect on low subdued tones their favorite choice in time of day being either dawn or twilight and even their brightest sunsets produced chiefly out of gray paper
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0012.wav it may be that a great colorist will use his utmost force of color as a singer his full power of voice but loud or low the virtue is in both cases always in refinement never in loudness
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0013.wav it must remember be one or the other
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0014.wav do not therefore think that the gothic school is an easy one
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0015.wav the law of that school is that everything shall be seen clearly or at least only in such mist or faintness as shall be delightful and i have no doubt that the best introduction to it would be the elementary practice of painting every study on a golden ground
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0016.wav this at once compels you to understand that the work is to be imaginative and decorative that it represents beautiful things in the clearest way but not under existing conditions and that in fact you are producing jewelers work rather than pictures
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0017.wav that a style is restrained or severe does not mean that it is also erroneous
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0018.wav in all early gothic art indeed you will find failure of this kind especially distortion and rigidity which are in many respects painfully to be compared with the splendid repose of classic art
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0019.wav the large letter contains indeed entirely feeble and ill drawn figures that is merely childish and failing work of an inferior hand it is not characteristic of gothic or any other school
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0020.wav but observe you can only do this on one condition that of striving also to create in reality the beauty which you seek in imagination
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0021.wav it will be wholly impossible for you to retain the tranquillity of temper and felicity of faith necessary for noble purist painting unless you are actively engaged in promoting the felicity and peace of practical life
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0022.wav you must look at him in the face fight him conquer him with what scathe you may you need not think to keep out of the way of him
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0023.wav the colorist says first of all as my delicious paroquet was ruby so this nasty viper shall be black and then is the question can i round him off even though he is black and make him slimy and yet springy and close down clotted like a pool of black blood on the earth all the same
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0024.wav nothing will be more precious to you i think in the practical study of art than the conviction which will force itself on you more and more every hour of the way all things are bound together little and great in spirit and in matter
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0025.wav you know i have just been telling you how this school of materialism and clay involved itself at last in cloud and fire
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0026.wav here is an equally typical greek school landscape by wilson lost wholly in golden mist the trees so slightly drawn that you dont know if they are trees or towers and no care for color whatever perfectly deceptive and marvelous effect of sunshine through the mist apollo and the python
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0027.wav now here is raphael exactly between the two trees still drawn leaf by leaf wholly formal but beautiful mist coming gradually into the distance
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0028.wav well then last here is turners greek school of the highest class and you define his art absolutely as first the displaying intensely and with the sternest intellect of natural form as it is and then the envelopment of it with cloud and fire
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0029.wav only there are two sorts of cloud and fire
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0030.wav he knows them both
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0031.wav theres one and theres another the dudley and the flint
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0032.wav it is only a pencil outline by edward burne jones in illustration of the story of psyche it is the introduction of psyche after all her troubles into heaven
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0033.wav every plant in the grass is set formally grows perfectly and may be realized completely
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0034.wav exquisite order and universal with eternal life and light this is the faith and effort of the schools of crystal and you may describe and complete their work quite literally by taking any verses of chaucer in his tender mood and observing how he insists on the clearness and brightness first and then on the order
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0035.wav thus in chaucers dream
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0036.wav in both these high mythical subjects the surrounding nature though suffering is still dignified and beautiful
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0037.wav every line in which the master traces it even where seemingly negligent is lovely and set down with a meditative calmness which makes these two etchings capable of being placed beside the most tranquil work of holbein or duerer
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0038.wav but now here is a subject of which you will wonder at first why turner drew it at all
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0039.wav it has no beauty whatsoever no specialty of picturesqueness and all its lines are cramped and poor
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0040.wav the crampness and the poverty are all intended
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0041.wav it is a gleaner bringing down her one sheaf of corn to an old watermill itself mossy and rent scarcely able to get its stones to turn
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0042.wav the scene is absolutely arcadian
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0043.wav see that your lives be in nothing worse than a boys climbing for his entangled kite
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0044.wav it will be well for you if you join not with those who instead of kites fly falcons who instead of obeying the last words of the great cloud shepherd to feed his sheep live the lives how much less than vanity of the war wolf and the gier eagle
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/7176/92135/7176-92135-0000.wav he is a welcome figure at the garden parties of the elect who are always ready to encourage him by accepting free seats for his play actor managers nod to him editors allow him to contribute without charge to a symposium on the price of golf balls
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/7176/92135/7176-92135-0001.wav in short he becomes a prominent figure in london society and if he is not careful somebody will say so
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/7176/92135/7176-92135-0002.wav but even the unsuccessful dramatist has his moments
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/7176/92135/7176-92135-0003.wav your play must be not merely a good play but a successful one
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/7176/92135/7176-92135-0004.wav frankly i cannot always say
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/7176/92135/7176-92135-0005.wav but suppose you said im fond of writing my people always say my letters home are good enough for punch
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/7176/92135/7176-92135-0006.wav ive got a little idea for a play about a man and a woman and another woman and but perhaps id better keep the plot a secret for the moment
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/7176/92135/7176-92135-0007.wav anyhow its jolly exciting and i can do the dialogue all right
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/7176/92135/7176-92135-0008.wav lend me your ear for ten minutes and you shall learn just what stagecraft is
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/7176/92135/7176-92135-0009.wav and i should begin with a short homily on soliloquy
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/7176/92135/7176-92135-0010.wav ham to be or not to be
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/7176/92135/7176-92135-0011.wav now the object of this soliloquy is plain
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/7176/92135/7176-92135-0012.wav indeed irresolution being the keynote of hamlets soliloquy a clever player could to some extent indicate the whole thirty lines by a silent working of the jaw but at the same time it would be idle to deny that he would miss the finer shades of the dramatists meaning
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/7176/92135/7176-92135-0013.wav we moderns however see the absurdity of it
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/7176/92135/7176-92135-0014.wav if it be granted first that the thoughts of a certain character should be known to the audience and secondly that soliloquy or the habit of thinking aloud is in opposition to modern stage technique how shall a soliloquy be avoided without damage to the play
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/7176/92135/7176-92135-0015.wav and so on till you get to the end when ophelia might say ah yes or something non committal of that sort
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/7176/92135/7176-92135-0016.wav this would be an easy way of doing it but it would not be the best way for the reason that it is too easy to call attention to itself
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/7176/92135/7176-92135-0017.wav in the old badly made play it was frequently necessary for one of the characters to take the audience into his confidence
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/7176/92135/7176-92135-0018.wav in the modern well constructed play he simply rings up an imaginary confederate and tells him what he is going to do could anything be more natural
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/7176/92135/7176-92135-0019.wav i want double nine hal lo

/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/7176/92135/7176-92135-0022.wav to be or not to be that is the question whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows what no hamlet speaking
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/7176/92135/7176-92135-0023.wav you gave me double five i want double nine hallo is that you horatio hamlet speaking
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/7176/92135/7176-92135-0024.wav to be or not to be that is the question whether tis nobler
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/7176/92135/7176-92135-0025.wav it is to let hamlet if that happen to be the name of your character enter with a small dog pet falcon mongoose tame bear or whatever animal is most in keeping with the part and confide in this animal such sorrows hopes or secret history as the audience has got to know
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/7176/92135/7176-92135-0026.wav enter hamlet with his favourite boar hound

/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/7021/79730/7021-79730-0005.wav so you will be a good girl i know and not make any trouble but will stay at home contentedly wont you

/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/7021/79740/7021-79740-0011.wav so saying she led the way on tiptoe followed by the children out of the room and round by a circuitous route to the piazza there

/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/4992/23283/4992-23283-0018.wav to relieve her from both he laid his hand with force upon his heart and said do you believe me

/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1580/141084/1580-141084-0022.wav and one more this morning
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1580/141084/1580-141084-0023.wav in a few hours the examination would commence and he was still in the dilemma between making the facts public and allowing the culprit to compete for the valuable scholarship
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1580/141084/1580-141084-0024.wav he could hardly stand still so great was his mental agitation and he ran towards holmes with two eager hands outstretched thank heaven that you have come
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1580/141084/1580-141084-0025.wav you know him i think so
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1580/141084/1580-141084-0026.wav if this matter is not to become public we must give ourselves certain powers and resolve ourselves into a small private court martial
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1580/141084/1580-141084-0027.wav no sir certainly not
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1580/141084/1580-141084-0028.wav there was no man sir
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1580/141084/1580-141084-0029.wav his troubled blue eyes glanced at each of us and finally rested with an expression of blank dismay upon bannister in the farther corner
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1580/141084/1580-141084-0030.wav just close the door said holmes

/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1580/141084/1580-141084-0032.wav for a moment gilchrist with upraised hand tried to control his writhing features
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1580/141084/1580-141084-0033.wav come come said holmes kindly it is human to err and at least no one can accuse you of being a callous criminal

/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1580/141084/1580-141084-0036.wav the indian i also thought nothing of
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1580/141084/1580-141084-0037.wav when i approached your room i examined the window
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1580/141084/1580-141084-0038.wav no one less than that would have a chance
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1580/141084/1580-141084-0039.wav i entered and i took you into my confidence as to the suggestions of the side table
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1580/141084/1580-141084-0040.wav he returned carrying his jumping shoes which are provided as you are aware with several sharp spikes
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1580/141084/1580-141084-0041.wav no harm would have been done had it not been that as he passed your door he perceived the key which had been left by the carelessness of your servant
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1580/141084/1580-141084-0042.wav a sudden impulse came over him to enter and see if they were indeed the proofs
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1580/141084/1580-141084-0043.wav he put his shoes on the table
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1580/141084/1580-141084-0044.wav gloves said the young man
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1580/141084/1580-141084-0045.wav suddenly he heard him at the very door there was no possible escape
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1580/141084/1580-141084-0046.wav have i told the truth mister gilchrist
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1580/141084/1580-141084-0047.wav i have a letter here mister soames which i wrote to you early this morning in the middle of a restless night
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1580/141084/1580-141084-0048.wav it will be clear to you from what i have said that only you could have let this young man out since you were left in the room and must have locked the door when you went out
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1580/141084/1580-141084-0049.wav it was simple enough sir if you only had known but with all your cleverness it was impossible that you could know
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1580/141084/1580-141084-0050.wav if mister soames saw them the game was up
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0000.wav i will endeavour in my statement to avoid such terms as would serve to limit the events to any particular place or give a clue as to the people concerned
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0001.wav i had always known him to be restless in his manner but on this particular occasion he was in such a state of uncontrollable agitation that it was clear something very unusual had occurred
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0002.wav my friends temper had not improved since he had been deprived of the congenial surroundings of baker street
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0003.wav without his scrapbooks his chemicals and his homely untidiness he was an uncomfortable man
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0004.wav i had to read it over carefully as the text must be absolutely correct
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0005.wav i was absent rather more than an hour
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0006.wav the only duplicate which existed so far as i knew was that which belonged to my servant bannister a man who has looked after my room for ten years and whose honesty is absolutely above suspicion
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0007.wav the moment i looked at my table i was aware that someone had rummaged among my papers
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0008.wav the proof was in three long slips i had left them all together
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0009.wav the alternative was that someone passing had observed the key in the door had known that i was out and had entered to look at the papers
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0010.wav i gave him a little brandy and left him collapsed in a chair while i made a most careful examination of the room
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0011.wav a broken tip of lead was lying there also
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0012.wav not only this but on the table i found a small ball of black dough or clay with specks of something which looks like sawdust in it
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0013.wav above all things i desire to settle the matter quietly and discreetly
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0014.wav to the best of my belief they were rolled up
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0015.wav did anyone know that these proofs would be there no one save the printer
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0016.wav i was in such a hurry to come to you you left your door open
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0017.wav so it seems to me
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0018.wav now mister soames at your disposal
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0019.wav above were three students one on each story
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0020.wav then he approached it and standing on tiptoe with his neck craned he looked into the room
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0021.wav there is no opening except the one pane said our learned guide
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0022.wav i am afraid there are no signs here said he
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0023.wav one could hardly hope for any upon so dry a day
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0024.wav you left him in a chair you say which chair by the window there
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0025.wav the man entered and took the papers sheet by sheet from the central table
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0026.wav as a matter of fact he could not said soames for i entered by the side door
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0027.wav how long would it take him to do that using every possible contraction a quarter of an hour not less
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0028.wav then he tossed it down and seized the next
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0029.wav he was in the midst of that when your return caused him to make a very hurried retreat very hurried since he had not time to replace the papers which would tell you that he had been there
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0030.wav mister soames was somewhat overwhelmed by this flood of information
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0031.wav holmes held out a small chip with the letters n n and a space of clear wood after them you see

/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0033.wav i was hoping that if the paper on which he wrote was thin some trace of it might come through upon this polished surface no i see nothing
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0034.wav as holmes drew the curtain i was aware from some little rigidity and alertness of his attitude that he was prepared for an emergency
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0035.wav holmes turned away and stooped suddenly to the floor halloa whats this
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0036.wav holmes held it out on his open palm in the glare of the electric light
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0037.wav what could he do he caught up everything which would betray him and he rushed into your bedroom to conceal himself
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0038.wav i understand you to say that there are three students who use this stair and are in the habit of passing your door yes there are
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0039.wav and they are all in for this examination yes
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0040.wav one hardly likes to throw suspicion where there are no proofs
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0041.wav let us hear the suspicions i will look after the proofs
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0042.wav my scholar has been left very poor but he is hard working and industrious he will do well
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0043.wav the top floor belongs to miles mc laren
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0044.wav i dare not go so far as that but of the three he is perhaps the least unlikely
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0045.wav he was still suffering from this sudden disturbance of the quiet routine of his life
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0046.wav but i have occasionally done the same thing at other times
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0047.wav did you look at these papers on the table

/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1995/1837/1995-1837-0024.wav for a while she lay in her chair in happy dreamy pleasure at sun and bird and tree
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1995/1837/1995-1837-0025.wav she rose with a fleeting glance gathered the shawl round her then gliding forward wavering tremulous slipped across the road and into the swamp

/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1995/1837/1995-1837-0029.wav he darted through the trees and paused a tall man strongly but slimly made

/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1995/1836/1995-1836-0001.wav at last the cotton combine was to all appearances an assured fact and he was slated for the senate
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1995/1836/1995-1836-0002.wav why should he not be as other men
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1995/1836/1995-1836-0003.wav she was not herself a notably intelligent woman she greatly admired intelligence or whatever looked to her like intelligence in others
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1995/1836/1995-1836-0004.wav as she awaited her guests she surveyed the table with both satisfaction and disquietude for her social functions were few tonight there were she checked them off on her fingers sir james creighton the rich english manufacturer and lady creighton mister and missus vanderpool mister harry cresswell and his sister john taylor and his sister and mister charles smith whom the evening papers mentioned as likely to be united states senator from new jersey a selection of guests that had been determined unknown to the hostess by the meeting of cotton interests earlier in the day
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1995/1836/1995-1836-0005.wav missus grey had met southerners before but not intimately and she always had in mind vividly their cruelty to poor negroes a subject she made a point of introducing forthwith
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1995/1836/1995-1836-0006.wav she was therefore most agreeably surprised to hear mister cresswell express himself so cordially as approving of negro education
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1995/1836/1995-1836-0007.wav but you believe in some education asked mary taylor
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1995/1836/1995-1836-0008.wav i believe in the training of people to their highest capacity the englishman here heartily seconded him
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1995/1836/1995-1836-0009.wav but cresswell added significantly capacity differs enormously between races
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1995/1836/1995-1836-0010.wav the vanderpools were sure of this and the englishman instancing india became quite eloquent missus grey was mystified but hardly dared admit it the general trend of the conversation seemed to be that most individuals needed to be submitted to the sharpest scrutiny before being allowed much education and as for the lower races it was simply criminal to open such useless opportunities to them
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1995/1836/1995-1836-0011.wav positively heroic added cresswell avoiding his sisters eyes
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1995/1836/1995-1836-0012.wav but were not er exactly welcomed
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1995/1836/1995-1836-0013.wav mary taylor however related the tale of zora to missus greys private ear later
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1995/1836/1995-1836-0014.wav fortunately said mister vanderpool northerners and southerners are arriving at a better mutual understanding on most of these matters
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/961/2961-961-0000.wav socrates begins the timaeus with a summary of the republic

/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/961/2961-961-0002.wav and therefore to you i turn timaeus citizen of locris who are at once a philosopher and a statesman and to you critias whom all athenians know to be similarly accomplished and to hermocrates who is also fitted by nature and education to share in our discourse
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/961/2961-961-0003.wav i will if timaeus approves i approve
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/961/2961-961-0004.wav listen then socrates to a tale of solons who being the friend of dropidas my great grandfather told it to my grandfather critias and he told me
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/961/2961-961-0005.wav some poems of solon were recited by the boys
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/961/2961-961-0006.wav and what was the subject of the poem said the person who made the remark
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/961/2961-961-0007.wav the subject was a very noble one he described the most famous action in which the athenian people were ever engaged
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/961/2961-961-0008.wav but the memory of their exploits has passed away owing to the lapse of time and the extinction of the actors
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/961/2961-961-0009.wav tell us said the other the whole story and where solon heard the story
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/961/2961-961-0010.wav but in egypt the traditions of our own and other lands are by us registered for ever in our temples
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/961/2961-961-0011.wav the genealogies which you have recited to us out of your own annals solon are a mere childrens story
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/961/2961-961-0012.wav for in the times before the great flood athens was the greatest and best of cities and did the noblest deeds and had the best constitution of any under the face of heaven
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/961/2961-961-0013.wav solon marvelled and desired to be informed of the particulars

/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/961/2961-961-0016.wav i will briefly describe them to you and you shall read the account of them at your leisure in the sacred registers
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/961/2961-961-0017.wav observe again what care the law took in the pursuit of wisdom searching out the deep things of the world and applying them to the use of man
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/961/2961-961-0018.wav the most famous of them all was the overthrow of the island of atlantis
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/961/2961-961-0019.wav for at the peril of her own existence and when the other hellenes had deserted her she repelled the invader and of her own accord gave liberty to all the nations within the pillars
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/961/2961-961-0020.wav this is the explanation of the shallows which are found in that part of the atlantic ocean
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/961/2961-961-0021.wav but i would not speak at the time because i wanted to refresh my memory
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/961/2961-961-0022.wav then now let me explain to you the order of our entertainment first timaeus who is a natural philosopher will speak of the origin of the world going down to the creation of man and then i shall receive the men whom he has created and some of whom will have been educated by you and introduce them to you as the lost athenian citizens of whom the egyptian record spoke
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0000.wav he passes abruptly from persons to ideas and numbers and from ideas and numbers to persons from the heavens to man from astronomy to physiology he confuses or rather does not distinguish subject and object first and final causes and is dreaming of geometrical figures lost in a flux of sense
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0001.wav the influence with the timaeus has exercised upon posterity is due partly to a misunderstanding
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0002.wav in the supposed depths of this dialogue the neo platonists found hidden meanings and connections with the jewish and christian scriptures and out of them they elicited doctrines quite at variance with the spirit of plato
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0003.wav they were absorbed in his theology and were under the dominion of his name while that which was truly great and truly characteristic in him his effort to realize and connect abstractions was not understood by them at all
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0004.wav there is no danger of the modern commentators on the timaeus falling into the absurdities of the neo platonists
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0005.wav in the present day we are well aware that an ancient philosopher is to be interpreted from himself and by the contemporary history of thought
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0006.wav the fancies of the neo platonists are only interesting to us because they exhibit a phase of the human mind which prevailed widely in the first centuries of the christian era and is not wholly extinct in our own day
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0007.wav but they have nothing to do with the interpretation of plato and in spirit they are opposed to him
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0008.wav we do not know how plato would have arranged his own dialogues or whether the thought of arranging any of them besides the two trilogies which he has expressly connected was ever present to his mind
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0009.wav the dialogue is primarily concerned with the animal creation including under this term the heavenly bodies and with man only as one among the animals
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0010.wav but he has not as yet defined this intermediate territory which lies somewhere between medicine and mathematics and he would have felt that there was as great an impiety in ranking theories of physics first in the order of knowledge as in placing the body before the soul
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0011.wav with heracleitus he acknowledges the perpetual flux like anaxagoras he asserts the predominance of mind although admitting an element of necessity which reason is incapable of subduing like the pythagoreans he supposes the mystery of the world to be contained in number
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0012.wav many if not all the elements of the pre socratic philosophy are included in the timaeus
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0013.wav it is probable that the relation of the ideas to god or of god to the world was differently conceived by him at different times of his life
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0014.wav the ideas also remain but they have become types in nature forms of men animals birds fishes
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0015.wav the style and plan of the timaeus differ greatly from that of any other of the platonic dialogues
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0016.wav but plato has not the same mastery over his instrument which he exhibits in the phaedrus or symposium
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0017.wav nothing can exceed the beauty or art of the introduction in which he is using words after his accustomed manner
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0018.wav but in the rest of the work the power of language seems to fail him and the dramatic form is wholly given up
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0019.wav he could write in one style but not in another and the greek language had not as yet been fashioned by any poet or philosopher to describe physical phenomena
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0020.wav and hence we find the same sort of clumsiness in the timaeus of plato which characterizes the philosophical poem of lucretius
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0021.wav there is a want of flow and often a defect of rhythm the meaning is sometimes obscure and there is a greater use of apposition and more of repetition than occurs in platos earlier writings
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0022.wav plato had not the command of his materials which would have enabled him to produce a perfect work of art
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/260/123440/260-123440-0000.wav and how odd the directions will look

/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0001.wav the place he had was a very good one the sun shone on him as to fresh air there was enough of that and round him grew many large sized comrades pines as well as firs
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0002.wav he did not think of the warm sun and of the fresh air he did not care for the little cottage children that ran about and prattled when they were in the woods looking for wild strawberries
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0003.wav but this was what the tree could not bear to hear
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0004.wav in winter when the snow lay glittering on the ground a hare would often come leaping along and jump right over the little tree

/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0006.wav to grow and grow to get older and be tall thought the tree that after all is the most delightful thing in the world

/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0009.wav have you not met them anywhere

/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0020.wav but the tree did not rejoice at all he grew and grew and was green both winter and summer
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0021.wav and towards christmas he was one of the first that was cut down
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0022.wav the axe struck deep into the very pith the tree fell to the earth with a sigh he felt a pang it was like a swoon he could not think of happiness for he was sorrowful at being separated from his home from the place where he had sprung up
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0023.wav he well knew that he should never see his dear old comrades the little bushes and flowers around him anymore perhaps not even the birds
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0024.wav the departure was not at all agreeable
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0025.wav the tree only came to himself when he was unloaded in a court yard with the other trees and heard a man say that one is splendid we dont want the others
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0026.wav there too were large easy chairs silken sofas large tables full of picture books and full of toys worth hundreds and hundreds of crowns at least the children said so
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0027.wav the servants as well as the young ladies decorated it

/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0030.wav perhaps the other trees from the forest will come to look at me

/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0033.wav a story
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0034.wav a story cried the children drawing a little fat man towards the tree
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0035.wav but i shall tell only one story

/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0038.wav thought the fir tree and believed it all because the man who told the story was so good looking well well
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0039.wav i wont tremble to morrow thought the fir tree
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0040.wav and the whole night the tree stood still and in deep thought
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0041.wav in the morning the servant and the housemaid came in
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0042.wav but they dragged him out of the room and up the stairs into the loft and here in a dark corner where no daylight could enter they left him
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0043.wav whats the meaning of this thought the tree
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0044.wav and he leaned against the wall lost in reverie

/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0055.wav and then he told all about his youth and the little mice had never heard the like before and they listened and said
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0056.wav said the fir tree thinking over what he had himself related

/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0017.wav edison had installed his historic first great central station system in new york on the multiple arc system covered by his feeder and main invention which resulted in a notable saving in the cost of conductors as against a straight two wire system throughout of the tree kind
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0018.wav he soon foresaw that still greater economy would be necessary for commercial success not alone for the larger territory opening but for the compact districts of large cities
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0019.wav the strong position held by the edison system under the strenuous competition that was already springing up was enormously improved by the introduction of the three wire system and it gave an immediate impetus to incandescent lighting
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0020.wav it was specially suited for a trial plant also in the early days when a yield of six or eight lamps to the horse power was considered subject for congratulation
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0021.wav the street conductors were of the overhead pole line construction and were installed by the construction company that had been organized by edison to build and equip central stations
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0022.wav meanwhile he had called upon me to make a report of the three wire system known in england as the hopkinson both doctor john hopkinson and mister edison being independent inventors at practically the same time
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0023.wav i think he was perhaps more appreciative than i was of the discipline of the edison construction department and thought it would be well for us to wait until the morning of the fourth before we started up
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0024.wav but the plant ran and it was the first three wire station in this country
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0025.wav they were later used as reserve machines and finally with the engine retired from service as part of the collection of edisonia but they remain in practically as good condition as when installed in eighteen eighty three
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0026.wav the arc lamp installed outside a customers premises or in a circuit for public street lighting burned so many hours nightly so many nights in the month and was paid for at that rate subject to rebate for hours when the lamp might be out through accident
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0027.wav edison held that the electricity sold must be measured just like gas or water and he proceeded to develop a meter
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0028.wav there was infinite scepticism around him on the subject and while other inventors were also giving the subject their thought the public took it for granted that anything so utterly intangible as electricity that could not be seen or weighed and only gave secondary evidence of itself at the exact point of use could not be brought to accurate registration
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0029.wav hence the edison electrolytic meter is no longer used despite its excellent qualities
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0030.wav the principle employed in the edison electrolytic meter is that which exemplifies the power of electricity to decompose a chemical substance
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0031.wav associated with this simple form of apparatus were various ingenious details and refinements to secure regularity of operation freedom from inaccuracy and immunity from such tampering as would permit theft of current or damage
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0032.wav the standard edison meter practice was to remove the cells once a month to the meter room of the central station company for examination another set being substituted
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0033.wav in december eighteen eighty eight mister w j jenks read an interesting paper before the american institute of electrical engineers on the six years of practical experience had up to that time with the meter then more generally in use than any other
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0034.wav the others having been in operation too short a time to show definite results although they also went quickly to a dividend basis
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0035.wav in this connection it should be mentioned that the association of edison illuminating companies in the same year adopted resolutions unanimously to the effect that the edison meter was accurate and that its use was not expensive for stations above one thousand lights and that the best financial results were invariably secured in a station selling current by meter
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0036.wav the meter continued in general service during eighteen ninety nine and probably up to the close of the century
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0037.wav he weighed and reweighed the meter plates and pursued every line of investigation imaginable but all in vain
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0038.wav he felt he was up against it and that perhaps another kind of a job would suit him better
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0039.wav the problem was solved
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0040.wav we were more interested in the technical condition of the station than in the commercial part
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0041.wav we had meters in which there were two bottles of liquid
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3979/2830-3979-0000.wav we want you to help us publish some leading work of luthers for the general american market will you do it
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3979/2830-3979-0001.wav the condition is that i will be permitted to make luther talk american streamline him so to speak because you will never get people whether in or outside the lutheran church actually to read luther unless we make him talk as he would talk today to americans
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3979/2830-3979-0002.wav let us begin with that his commentary on galatians
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3979/2830-3979-0003.wav the undertaking which seemed so attractive when viewed as a literary task proved a most difficult one and at times became oppressive
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3979/2830-3979-0004.wav it was written in latin
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3979/2830-3979-0005.wav the work had to be condensed
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3979/2830-3979-0006.wav a word should now be said about the origin of luthers commentary on galatians
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3979/2830-3979-0007.wav much later when a friend of his was preparing an edition of all his latin works he remarked to his home circle if i had my way about it they would republish only those of my books which have doctrine my galatians for instance
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3979/2830-3979-0008.wav in other words these three men took down the lectures which luther addressed to his students in the course of galatians and roerer prepared the manuscript for the printer
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3979/2830-3979-0009.wav it presents like no other of luthers writings the central thought of christianity the justification of the sinner for the sake of christs merits alone
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3979/2830-3979-0010.wav but the essence of luthers lectures is there
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3979/2830-3979-0011.wav the lord who has given us power to teach and to hear let him also give us the power to serve and to do luke two

/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0000.wav in every way they sought to undermine the authority of saint paul
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0001.wav they said to the galatians you have no right to think highly of paul
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0002.wav he was the last to turn to christ
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0003.wav paul came later and is beneath us
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0004.wav indeed he persecuted the church of christ for a long time
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0005.wav do you suppose that god for the sake of a few lutheran heretics would disown his entire church
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0006.wav against these boasting false apostles paul boldly defends his apostolic authority and ministry
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0007.wav as the ambassador of a government is honored for his office and not for his private person so the minister of christ should exalt his office in order to gain authority among men
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0008.wav paul takes pride in his ministry not to his own praise but to the praise of god
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0009.wav paul an apostle not of men et cetera
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0010.wav either he calls ministers through the agency of men or he calls them directly as he called the prophets and apostles
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0011.wav paul declares that the false apostles were called or sent neither by men nor by man
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0012.wav the most they could claim is that they were sent by others
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0013.wav he mentions the apostles first because they were appointed directly by god
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0014.wav the call is not to be taken lightly

/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0016.wav it spoils ones best work
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0017.wav when i was a young man i thought paul was making too much of his call
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0018.wav i did not then realize the importance of the ministry
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0019.wav i knew nothing of the doctrine of faith because we were taught sophistry instead of certainty and nobody understood spiritual boasting
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0020.wav this is no sinful pride it is holy pride
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0021.wav and god the father who raised him from the dead
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0022.wav the clause seems superfluous on first sight
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0023.wav these perverters of the righteousness of christ resist the father and the son and the works of them both
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0024.wav in this whole epistle paul treats of the resurrection of christ
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0025.wav by his resurrection christ won the victory over law sin flesh world devil death hell and every evil

/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0028.wav this should go far in shutting the mouths of the false apostles

/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0037.wav so much for the title of the epistle now follows the greeting of the apostle verse three
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0038.wav grace be to you and peace from god the father and from our lord jesus christ
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0039.wav the terms of grace and peace are common terms with paul and are now pretty well understood
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0040.wav the greeting of the apostle is refreshing
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0041.wav grace involves the remission of sins peace and a happy conscience
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0042.wav the world brands this a pernicious doctrine
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0043.wav experience proves this
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0044.wav however the grace and peace of god will
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0045.wav men should not speculate about the nature of god
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0046.wav was it not enough to say from god the father
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0047.wav to do so is to lose god altogether because god becomes intolerable when we seek to measure and to comprehend his infinite majesty
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0048.wav he came down to earth lived among men suffered was crucified and then he died standing clearly before us so that our hearts and eyes may fasten upon him
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0049.wav embrace him and forget about the nature of god

/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0052.wav we are to hear christ who has been appointed by the father as our divine teacher
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0053.wav at the same time paul confirms our creed that christ is very god
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0054.wav that christ is very god is apparent in that paul ascribes to him divine powers equally with the father as for instance the power to dispense grace and peace
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0055.wav to bestow peace and grace lies in the province of god who alone can create these blessings the angels cannot
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0056.wav otherwise paul should have written grace from god the father and peace from our lord jesus christ

/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0059.wav paul sticks to his theme
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0060.wav he never loses sight of the purpose of his epistle
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0061.wav not gold or silver or paschal lambs or an angel but himself what for

/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0064.wav how may we obtain remission of our sins
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0065.wav paul answers the man who is named jesus christ and the son of god gave himself for our sins
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0066.wav since christ was given for our sins it stands to reason that they cannot be put away by our own efforts
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0067.wav this sentence also defines our sins as great so great in fact that the whole world could not make amends for a single sin
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0068.wav the greatness of the ransom christ the son of god indicates this
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0069.wav the vicious character of sin is brought out by the words who gave himself for our sins
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0070.wav but we are careless we make light of sin
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0071.wav we think that by some little work or merit we can dismiss sin
/home/marc/workspace/speech/data/libri_speech/LibriSpeech/test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0072.wav this passage then bears out the fact that all men are sold under sin
